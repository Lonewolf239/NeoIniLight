### Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Contact the maintainer directly:

- **Telegram:** [@an1onime](https://t.me/an1onime)

Include in your report:

1. **Affected version(s).**
2. **Description** of the vulnerability and its impact.
3. **Reproduction steps** — minimal code or configuration to trigger the issue.
4. **Suggested fix** (if you have one).

You will receive an acknowledgment within **48 hours**. A fix will be developed privately and released as a patch before public disclosure.

### Scope

The following areas are in scope for security reports:

- File I/O race conditions (atomic writes, temp files).
- Thread-safety issues under concurrent access.

Out of scope: denial-of-service via intentionally malformed INI files with extreme sizes.

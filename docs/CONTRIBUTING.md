## Contributing to NeoIniLight

NeoIniLight welcomes bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests. This guide covers the process for each.

---

### Bug reports

Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Lonewolf239/NeoIniLight/issues) with:

- **NeoIniLight version** (current: `1.0`) and **.NET version**.
- **Minimal reproduction** — code snippet or repo that triggers the bug.
- **Expected vs. actual behavior.**
- **Stack trace** (if applicable).

Check existing issues before opening a duplicate.

> **Security vulnerabilities:** Do not report in public issues. Follow the [Security Policy](./SECURITY.md).

---

### Feature requests

Open an issue with the **Feature Request** label. Include:

- **Use case** — what problem does the feature solve?
- **Proposed API** — how would the feature look from the caller's perspective?
- **Alternatives considered** — other approaches you evaluated.

---

### Development workflow

1. **Fork & clone** the repository.
2. **Create a branch** from `main`:
   - Bug fix: `fix/short-description`
   - Feature: `feature/short-description`
   - Docs: `docs/short-description`
3. **Write code** following the existing conventions:
   - All public API changes require XML doc comments.
   - Thread safety: acquire the internal lock for any shared-state access.
   - Async methods must accept and forward `CancellationToken`.
   - No additional dependencies without prior discussion.
4. **Test** your changes — include unit tests for new functionality and regression tests for bug fixes.
5. **Open a pull request** against `main`.

### Pull request requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Branch | Based on latest `main` |
| Scope | One logical change per PR |
| Tests | All existing tests pass; new tests cover the change |
| Docs | Update relevant docs if the public API changes |
| Commit messages | Imperative mood, concise (`Fix race condition on concurrent reload`) |

PRs are reviewed by the maintainer. Address feedback promptly — stale PRs may be closed after 30 days.
